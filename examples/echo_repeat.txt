***Ask for a one digit input, echo it back, and repeat

9999 This is the program loop
Let's force FLAG=false, just for sanity: 3776377

999 This is the loop for calling echo and then resetting the tape

833
20146646549966155507799 The original echo script, which is used to reset the tape
8

33 <- (This is so we can skip the echo function after cleaning the tape)
20146646549966155507799

077999
33 and this is where we skip to to break the loop

FLAG will still be true by the time we get to here, making it an infinite loop
